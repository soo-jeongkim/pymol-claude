# pymol-claude

tldr - PyMOL plugin that turns PyMOL into an MCP server. Drive PyMOL from Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client.

## What it is

`pymol-claude` lets you drive PyMOL from Cursor or Claude Code (or any MCP client) in English — load structures, color, align, score, render.

It ships with `gemmi`-backed metric tools, so pLDDT, ipTM, pTM, and PAE can be read from the CIF (or PDB) files without rendering. You can use it to triage with queries like "which design has the worst ipTM?" come back as fast text answers. You can also drop a `.py` of your own PyMOL custom presets and analysis functions within the cloned dir and ask the agent to use it.

Because it can work over Claude Code, anything you can do in a Claude Code session you can do here — including `/remote-control`, which lets you drive your workstation's PyMOL from the Claude mobile app.

For cluster users: run PyMOL locally as usual and point it at your remote CIFs through your mounted cluster path as per usual (SSHFS/NFS/etc.), anything visible locally works!

An example session in Claude Code/cursor:

```
> Load all the CIF files in /path/to/dir/w/predicted/structures/
[all the structures visible on PyMOL window]
Loaded all structures, sorted by mean pLDDT.

> Which one has the worst ipTM?
model_3 — ipTM 0.41 (others are 0.7+).

> Show me the low-confidence loops on structure_500.
[renders cartoon on PyMOL window, residues 142–168 highlighted, mean pLDDT 38]

```

## Install

The plugin installs into **PyMOL's bundled Python**, not your system Python.

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soo-jeongkim/pymol-claude.git
cd pymol-claude
```

### 2. Find PyMOL's Python

On macOS, the default PyMOL.app install ships with:

```
/Applications/PyMOL.app/Contents/bin/python
```

On Linux, conda, or a non-standard install, ask PyMOL itself:

```bash
pymol -c -q -d "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

PyMOL may print startup noise around it — grab the path that looks like a Python interpreter.

Throughout the rest of these instructions, `$PYMOL_PY` refers to that path. Export it once and the rest of the install is copy-paste:

```bash
export PYMOL_PY=/Applications/PyMOL.app/Contents/bin/python   # macOS — or paste your path
```

Sanity check before continuing:

```bash
$PYMOL_PY -c "import pymol; print(pymol.__file__)"
```

If that errors, `$PYMOL_PY` isn't PyMOL's Python — re-check step 2 before running step 3.

### 3. Install the plugin into PyMOL's Python

```bash
$PYMOL_PY -m pip install -e .
```

This also drops a `pymol-claude` shim into PyMOL's `bin/` directory (sibling of `$PYMOL_PY`). The rest of this README invokes it as `$PYMOL_PY -m pymol_claude.cli ...` so the commands work whether or not you've put PyMOL's `bin/` on your `PATH`. If you have, the shorter `pymol-claude ...` form works too.

`sudo` is usually unnecessary and best avoided.

### 4. Tell PyMOL to start the plugin on launch

Add to `~/.pymolrc.py` (create it if missing):

```python
from pymol_claude import __init_plugin__
__init_plugin__()
```

### 5. Restart PyMOL

The console should print:

```
pymol-claude: MCP server running on http://127.0.0.1:8766/sse
```

If it doesn't, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### 6. Wire up your MCP client

Pick whichever you use. Both setups are **global** — every Cursor window or Claude Code session will see the `pymol` server, no need to `cd` into this repo first.

**Cursor:**

```bash
$PYMOL_PY -m pymol_claude.cli install-config
```

Writes `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, merging with any existing entries. Restart Cursor (full quit, not just window reload); verify under Settings → Cursor Settings → MCP that `pymol` is listed.

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse --scope user pymol http://localhost:8766/sse
```

Works from any directory. `claude mcp list` should now show `pymol`.

> The `install-config` CLI currently writes only Cursor config. For Claude Code, `claude mcp add` is the canonical path — there's no `pymol-claude` equivalent yet.

## Usage

1. Open PyMOL (the MCP server auto-starts).
2. Open Claude Code (`claude` in a terminal) or Cursor with MCP enabled.
3. Talk to it:
   - "Load all CIF files in `<dir>`, sorted by ipTM"
   - "Color by pLDDT, then render a ray-traced PNG"
   - "Align model_0 onto model_1; what's the RMSD?"
   - "Look at `~/scripts/my_pymol_helpers.py` — apply the publication-style view to all objects"

## Tools

One general-purpose tool, plus a handful of dedicated ones.

### `run(code)` — the workhorse

Arbitrary Python with `cmd` (PyMOL's `pymol.cmd`) bound. The client writes PyMOL directly rather than calling a wrapper per verb. Examples of what a client might actually send:

```python
run("cmd.load('foo.cif'); cmd.color('salmon', 'chain A')")

run("""
cmd.fetch('1ubq', async_=0)
cmd.hide('everything'); cmd.show('cartoon')
cmd.color('marine')
cmd.orient()
""")

run("""
print(cmd.get_object_list())
print('Polymer atoms:', cmd.count_atoms('polymer'))
""")
```

Stdout is returned to the client. Use `run` for anything PyMOL-y the dedicated tools below don't already cover.

### Rendering

- `render(width, height, ray=True)` — ray-traced PNG, returned inline.
- `snapshot(width, height)` — fast, non-ray PNG.
- `color_by_plddt(selection)` — applies the project palette (blue=high → red=low).

### Metrics (gemmi, not PyMOL)

Reads `_ma_qa_metric_*` from mmCIF first, falls back to sibling JSON (AF3 server and AF2-multimer layouts both work).

- `get_metrics(name)` — full per-structure report: chains, residue count, pLDDT bands, ipTM, pTM, ranking_score, mean PAE. Reach for it when you want everything you know about one model.
- `find_low_confidence(name, threshold=70)` — contiguous regions below a pLDDT threshold. Reach for it when you want "where exactly is this model uncertain?" rather than a single number.
- `compare_all()` — sorted table of every loaded structure with pLDDT, ipTM, pTM columns. Reach for it after `load_directory` when you want a ranking.
- `cif_grep(tag, path)` — search `.cif` files for a tag value (e.g. `_ma_qa_metric_global.metric_value`) across a directory. Reach for it when you need a one-off field the structured tools don't expose.

### Triage

A stateful navigator for reviewing a batch of structures (the mobile-eval workflow):

- `load_directory(path)` — scan a directory, extract metrics, load all structures into PyMOL, set up the navigation cursor.
- `next_structure` / `prev_structure` / `go_to(n)` / `current` — move the cursor; each call hides the others, colors by pLDDT, orients, renders.
- `flag(note)` / `show_flags` / `export_flags` — flag the current structure with a note; export as JSON for downstream tools.
- `filter(min_plddt, max_plddt)` — restrict navigation to structures in a pLDDT range.

## Troubleshooting

**"MCP server running on..." doesn't appear when PyMOL starts.**
- *Port 8766 already in use.* Another PyMOL session is running, or another process owns the port. `lsof -iTCP:8766` to check; close the offender or restart on a different port from PyMOL's CLI: `stop_mcp` then `start_mcp 8767`.
- *Plugin not found.* Step 3 likely installed into the wrong Python. Run `$PYMOL_PY -c "import pymol_claude; print(pymol_claude.__file__)"` — it should print a path. If it errors, re-run step 3 with the path from step 2.
- *`~/.pymolrc.py` not loaded.* Add `print("pymolrc loaded")` to the top; if you don't see it, PyMOL isn't reading the file (check PyMOL's working dir; it loads from `$HOME`).

**MCP client can't see the `pymol` server.**
- *Cursor:* fully quit and reopen — a window reload isn't enough. Check Settings → Cursor Settings → MCP.
- *Claude Code:* `claude mcp list` to confirm `pymol` is registered.
- *Either:* `curl http://localhost:8766/sse` should hang open (SSE). If it errors, PyMOL isn't running, the plugin didn't start, or the port is blocked.

**Manual server control (inside PyMOL):**

```
start_mcp [port]   # auto-runs on plugin load; use this to restart on a new port
stop_mcp           # stop the server
```

**Skipping the pip install.** To run from this clone without installing, point `~/.pymolrc.py` at it via `sys.path`:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/path/to/pymol-claude")
from pymol_claude import __init_plugin__
__init_plugin__()
```

For step 6 (Cursor), `python -m pymol_claude.cli install-config` works from inside the clone with any Python.

**Project-scoped Cursor config.** To enable `pymol` only inside one project (e.g. to point at a different port for that workspace):

```bash
$PYMOL_PY -m pymol_claude.cli install-config --project --project-dir /path/to/project
```

Writes `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json`. Cursor merges project and global configs; project entries override the global `pymol` entry in that workspace — occasionally what you want, otherwise surprising.
